# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end *data analytics workflow*, starting from loading raw data in Python to delivering business insights through SQL analysis, Power BI dashboards, and final reporting.  
The goal of the project is to analyze data, identify patterns and trends, and present actionable insights in a clear and visual manner for stakeholders.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains structured records related to customer / transactional / behavioral data.
- It includes both numerical and categorical features used for analysis and reporting.
- Raw data was first explored and cleaned before further analysis.

## 🔄 Project Workflow / Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas.
- Verified schema, data types, and basic statistics.

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed data distribution, trends, and patterns.
- Identified missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- Generated summary statistics to understand key variables.

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handled missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
- Standardized column names for consistency.
- Removed duplicates and corrected data types.
- Performed basic feature engineering where required.

### 4️⃣ SQL Analysis (MySQL)
- Loaded cleaned data into a MySQL database.
- Wrote SQL queries to:
  - Validate results from Python analysis
  - Perform aggregations and filtering
  - Answer specific business questions

### 5️⃣ Power BI Dashboard
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard using the cleaned data.
- Created KPIs and visualizations to track key metrics.
- Enabled filtering and slicing for better insights.

### 6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation
- Summarized findings in a structured report.
- Created a PowerPoint presentation highlighting:
  - Key insights
  - Visuals from the dashboard
  - Business recommendations

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Trend analysis across different dimensions
- Category-wise and segment-wise comparisons
- Interactive filters for user-driven exploration

---

## 📈 Key Results & Insights
- Identified important trends and patterns in the data.
- Highlighted factors influencing key business metrics.
